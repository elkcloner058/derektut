when i love you 
just close my eyes 
and i'm with you
 and holding my hands
 and i'm feeling love.
<<<<<<< HEAD
 when the night has come
 and the land is dark
 and the moon is the only light will see
 no i won't i won't i won't be afraid 
 if these you and me stand by me
 so darling darling stand by me.
 oh stand by me.
 if the sky that we are looking for
