when i need you 
just close my eyes 
and i'm with you
 and holding my hands
 and i'm feeling love.

 //tui ki janish na tor jonno kanna vorer ghasher thother shishir hoe chote 
 janish na ki tui ssss
 when the night has come
 and the land is dark
 and the moon is the only light will see
 no i won't i won't i won't be afraid 
 if these you and me stand by me
 so darling darling stand by me.
 oh stand by me.
 if the sky that we are looking for
